As an early partner at Learners Guild, I worked closely with a team of learning scientists, radical educators, and technologists to design a novel kind of software apprenticeship program with a strong focus on economic justice and accessibility. Being a part of a small team meant that I wore many hats: education designer, apprentice mentor, project manager, content developer.
