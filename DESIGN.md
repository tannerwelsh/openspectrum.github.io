# Design notes

## Themes

big list of themes: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes

top choice!!!: https://github.com/broccolini/athena

http://broccolini.net/swiss/ - also this is pretty good

https://andrewbanchich.github.io/forty-jekyll-theme/ - a little too colorful maybe, more content than needed
http://hyde.getpoole.com/ - the original Hyde, 2 column
https://qwtel.com/hydejack/projects/ - too heavy? good and simple design tho
https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/ - basic, supported by GH pages

## Inspiration

- http://www.paperplanes.de/ - way too simple probs
- http://www.nathanielkoloc.com/ - below the fold is not so great, but good header
- http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile - menu kinda cool, layout not so much
- http://ellensriley.com/#work - typography is not so great, but the overall feel is nice
- http://www.laurenicolesmith.com/ - super basic but cool
- http://www.garicruze.com/ - nice photo focus, too flashy tho
- http://www.quinntonharris.com/ - beautiful entry, tho more photo heavy than i could pull off
